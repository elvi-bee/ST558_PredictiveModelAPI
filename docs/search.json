    "text": "This project explores data on Diabetes. The original data were obtained from the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC. The data contain self-reported health and lifestyle information and include 22 variables related to chronic disease, physical activity, general health, demographics, and access to health care. The primary outcome of interest in this project is ‘Diabetes_binary’, a binary indicator where:\n\n0 = No diabetes\n1 = Diabetes\n\nThe majority of remaining variables are coded as binary (0/1) indicators (e.g., HighBP, HighChol, Stroke, Smoker), with some coded as ordinal categories (e.g., Age, Education, Income) or counts (e.g., MentHlth, PhysHlth).\nFor this project, a csv of the data available on Kaggle for the year 2015 was used. The data contain 253,680 responses.\nThis project consists of two sections:\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\n\nThe purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis is to better understand the structure of the data and how the data are stored. We will conduct basic data validation, including determining the number and type of variables included and whether there are missing values. The data will be cleaned and transformed/formatted to prepare it for exploratory analysis and modeling. Additionally, distributions and relationships between variables will be investigated to inform modeling.\n\nModeling\n\nThe purpose of the modeling section is to build and evaluate two predictive models that classify individuals as having diabetes or not, based on demographic, behavioral, and health-related variables explored in this EDA section. A classification tree and a random forest model will be constructed and compared in tidymodels, with the goal of selecting the best predictive model for the data.\nClick here for the Modeling Page"

Plots and tables below indicate that individuals with Diabetes tend to have a higher mean and median BMI. Physical Health was measured as the number of days in the past month when physical health was not good. Individuals with diabetes reported more days of poor physical health. Mental health was measured as the number of days in the past month when mental health was not good. Individuals with diabetes reported slightly more days of poor mental health, but this relationship was much weaker.\n\n# BMI\nggplot(data, aes(x = bmi, fill = diabetes_binary)) +\n  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = \"identity\", bins = 40) +\n  labs(title = \"BMI Distribution by Diabetes Status\",\n       x = \"BMI\", \n       y = \"Count\",\n       fill = \"Diabetes Status\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = diabetes_binary, y = bmi, fill = diabetes_binary)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"BMI by Diabetes Status\",\n    x = \"Diabetes Status\",\n    y = \"BMI\",\n    fill = \"Diabetes Status\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbmi_summary &lt;- data |&gt;\n  group_by(diabetes_binary) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    n = n(),\n    mean_bmi   = mean(bmi),\n    median_bmi = median(bmi),\n    sd_bmi     = sd(bmi)\n  )\n\nbmi_summary\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  diabetes_binary      n mean_bmi median_bmi sd_bmi\n  &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No              218334     27.8         27   6.29\n2 Yes              35346     31.9         31   7.36\n\n# ment_health and phys_health\ndata &lt;- data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    ment_hlth_num = as.numeric(as.character(ment_hlth)),\n    phys_hlth_num = as.numeric(as.character(phys_hlth))\n  )\nggplot(data, aes(x = diabetes_binary, y = ment_hlth_num, fill = diabetes_binary)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Days of Poor Mental Health by Diabetes Status\",\n    x = \"Diabetes Status\",\n    y = \"Poor Mental Health Days (0–30)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = diabetes_binary, y = phys_hlth_num, fill = diabetes_binary)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Days of Poor Physical Health by Diabetes Status\",\n    x = \"Diabetes Status\",\n    y = \"Poor Physical Health Days (0–30)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nment_phys_summary &lt;- data |&gt;\n  group_by(diabetes_binary) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    mean_ment_hlth = mean(ment_hlth_num, na.rm = TRUE),\n    median_ment_hlth = median(ment_hlth_num, na.rm = TRUE),\n    mean_phys_hlth = mean(phys_hlth_num, na.rm = TRUE),\n    median_phys_hlth = median(phys_hlth_num, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nment_phys_summary\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  diabetes_binary mean_ment_hlth median_ment_hlth mean_phys_hlth\n  &lt;fct&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No                        2.98                0           3.64\n2 Yes                       4.46                0           7.95\n# ℹ 1 more variable: median_phys_hlth &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Ordinal Variables\nOrdinal variables included Age, General Health (self-rated), Income, and Education.\nDiabetes prevalence appears to increase steadily across Age groups. Similarly, a strong patterns is present in General Health. Individuals rating their health as “Fair” or “Poor” show higher diabetes prevalence than those reporting “Good,” “Very Good,” or “Excellent” general health. Income also shows a clear inverse relationship with diabetes, with lower-income categories showing higher diabetes prevalence. Education shows a slight pattern with a modest decrease in diabetes prevalence with higher educational attainment, but the differences between adjacent categories are smaller than those seen for age, general health, or income.\nOverall, the ordinal variables display relationships with diabetes prevalence, particularly age and general health.\n\n# Convert ordinal vars to ordered factors with labels\ndata &lt;- data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    age = fct_recode(age,\n                     \"18–24\" = \"1\", \"25–29\" = \"2\", \"30–34\" = \"3\", \"35–39\" = \"4\",\n                     \"40–44\" = \"5\", \"45–49\" = \"6\", \"50–54\" = \"7\", \"55–59\" = \"8\",\n                     \"60–64\" = \"9\", \"65–69\" = \"10\", \"70–74\" = \"11\", \"75–79\" = \"12\",\n                     \"80+\" = \"13\"),\n    age = fct_relevel(age, \n                      \"18–24\",\"25–29\",\"30–34\",\"35–39\",\"40–44\",\"45–49\",\"50–54\",\n                      \"55–59\",\"60–64\",\"65–69\",\"70–74\",\"75–79\",\"80+\"),\n    \n    gen_hlth = fct_recode(gen_hlth,\n                          \"Excellent\" = \"1\",\n                          \"Very Good\" = \"2\",\n                          \"Good\" = \"3\",\n                          \"Fair\" = \"4\",\n                          \"Poor\" = \"5\"),\n    gen_hlth = fct_relevel(gen_hlth,\n                           \"Excellent\",\"Very Good\",\"Good\",\"Fair\",\"Poor\"),\n    \n    education = fct_recode(education,\n                           \"Never attended\" = \"1\",\n                           \"Elementary\" = \"2\",\n                           \"Some high school\" = \"3\",\n                           \"High school grad\" = \"4\",\n                           \"Some college\" = \"5\",\n                           \"College graduate\" = \"6\"),\n    \n    income = fct_recode(income,\n                        \"&lt;$10k\" = \"1\", \"$10–15k\" = \"2\", \"$15–20k\" = \"3\",\n                        \"$20–25k\" = \"4\", \"$25–35k\" = \"5\", \"$35–50k\" = \"6\",\n                        \"$50–75k\" = \"7\", \"&gt;$75k\" = \"8\")\n  )\n\n# Age\nggplot(data, aes(x = age, fill = diabetes_binary)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportion of Diabetes by Age Group\",\n    x = \"Age Group\",\n    y = \"Proportion\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# General Health\nggplot(data, aes(x = gen_hlth, fill = diabetes_binary)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Diabetes Proportion by Self-Rated General Health\",\n    x = \"General Health Rating\",\n    y = \"Proportion\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Education\nggplot(data, aes(x = education, fill = diabetes_binary)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportion of Diabetes by Education Level\",\n    x = \"Education Level\",\n    y = \"Proportion\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Income\nggplot(data, aes(x = income, fill = diabetes_binary)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportion of Diabetes by Income Category\",\n    x = \"Income Level\",\n    y = \"Proportion\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Summary\nAmong the variables that were assessed, many showed interesting relationships with Diabetes prevalence. Among binary variables, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease or attack status, physical activity, and difficulty walking all showed relationships with diabetes prevalence. Among numeric variables, BMI and physical health showed the strongest relationships. Among ordinal variables, age and general health appeared to have stronger relations with diabetes that other ordinal variables.\nIn section 2 we will proceed to construct two models using selected variables from the aforementioned data.
